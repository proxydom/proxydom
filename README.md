# proxydom's profile  
Just an Italian college student who loves cats, beer and cybersecurity.  

## Who I Am
- Currently in my first year of college.  
- Bit of a nerd, i enjoy spending time reading books and articles.  
- As I said, I love cats.  
- Passionate about cybersecurity, especially pentesting, malware analysis, reverse engineering, network security, and exploit development (not really into OSINT, unless i need to search for cats).  
## What i do 
- I mainly code in **C, C++, PHP, and JavaScript**, but looking to learn **Java and Rust**.  
- Working on some **offensive security projects**, including a **cookies stealer** and other cryptography and network tools.
- Linux user (Arch btw).  
- Not that much of a gamer. I do enjoy Minecraft with mods, though. 
## How to reach me 
If you're into cybersecurity, research, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out.
